data-structures-c
-----------------
A very naive implementation of the fundamental, popular and well-known data 
structures in pure C for educational purposes.

**Note**: This is just for my own benefit. I'm sure there are/will be plenty of 
really ugly bugs in my code. I am, by no means, a good programmer. I am much 
less inclined in C than I am in Objective-C and Ruby. So, please don't use any 
of what I have here as any sort of code that should perform any real-world 
tasks. If you have any suggestions or corrections, please let me know. After 
all, I'm doing this to (re)learn.

### Purpose
* Fun
* Science
* Profit?

### Goals
* Fully implement the following data structures in C. Note that this list is incomplete. I'll add more data structures as I work through these ones.
    * Dynamic Array: **Fully implemented**
    * Singly-Linked List: **Fully implemented**
    * Doubly-Linked List
    * Hash/dictionary of some kind
    * Binary Tree
    * Graph, of some kind. Perhaps Adjacency List?
    * ???
* Complexity analysis for everything I implement
* Fully document everything
* Re-learn/remember the intricacies of implementing data structures
* Get a chance to play around with pure C again. No strange libraries or weird attachments. Just me, the compiler and the kernel.

### Environment
It shouldn't really matter, but I'm doing this on Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) with the latest version of Xcode's command line tools.

### How to Compile and Run
In case you're crazy enough to want to look at my ugly code, there is a makefile 
that can compile and run all the data structures and the tests. Simply run the 
following:
    
    $ make run
